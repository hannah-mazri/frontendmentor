## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- To embed a font, use `<link>` instead of `@import`. Using `@import` works but returns sameSite error

### Continued development

- To refine how the background image looks like in different screen sizes

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - This helped me understand how to use background and its properties
